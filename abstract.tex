\emph{Type inference} allows programmers to omit type annotations while still permitting type checking. The problem is that \emph{type inference} only works on complete programs, e.g. syntactically well-formed expressions. This paper introduces a \emph{type hole inference} system that applies type inference on incomplete programs. We start from modeling incomplete programs by \emph{holes} developed in \HazelnutLive, where holes stand for missing types and expressions. Rather than obtaining limited static type information for type holes from bidirectional typing propagation, we extended static semantics with \emph{type constraints}, and borrow machinery from unification-based type inference to infer types for type holes. Our approach shares benefits of \emph{bidirectional typing}, which produces good-quality error messages, and unification, which infers types for unknown parts of incomplete programs to collect as much static type information as possible.
