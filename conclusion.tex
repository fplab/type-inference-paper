\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper develops \emph{type hole inference} which takes advantage of bidirectional typing and type inference. \emph{Type hole inference} is based on simple bidirectional typing for straightforward type checking and clear error messages, then adopts the hole typing system and constraint solving to insert and fill type annotations automatically. In the future work, the constraint solver will support returning a list of potential H-types for type holes when unification can not find a solution. This will be implemented into the \Hazel environment, so programmers can make better type decisions during development.
