# type-inference-paper

For those navigating the branches:
   the master branch does not contain much
   dev contains some useful testcases and all of Zoe's previous working code
   new-alg contains Zoe's start to a WIP algorithm that seems to deal with equation solving and consistency checks
   top-sort contains new code dealing with substituting unification results into each other with type dependencies accounted for
